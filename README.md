# MAUI-Bubble-Chart-to-Visualize-Market-Cap-Distribution-by-Countries
This sample demonstrates how to create a MAUI [Bubble Chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts/chart-types/maui-bubble-chart) using SfCartesianChart from Syncfusion Charts to analyze market capitalization distribution across multiple countries.

One of the unique features of the **Bubble Chart** is its ability to effectively illustrate variations in market cap. For instance, the United States market, represented by the largest bubble, signifies its dominant position in terms of market capitalization, GDP, and number of companies. In contrast, a smaller bubble representing Vietnam highlights its status as an emerging market with a lower market cap, GDP, and fewer companies.

## Key features of the Syncfusion MAUI Bubble chart
The key features of the bubble chart customization include chart features such as chart title, axis customization and tooltip customization.

### Chart title customization:
In the Syncfusion MAUI Chart, the [Title](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartBase.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartBase_Title) property serves as a crucial element for enhancing the overall clarity and context of the chart. This property allows you to define a descriptive title that succinctly conveys the purpose or subject of the visualization, making it easier for users to understand the data being presented.

### Tooltip customization
Syncfusion charts provide robust options for customizing [tooltips](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/tooltip#template), enhancing data interactivity and user experience. Tooltips can display detailed information about each data point, making it easier for users to interpret the underlying data. In the example below, we will customize tooltips to show specific metrics related to each country's market cap, GDP, and the number of companies.


### Customizing the Series
The Syncfusion [MAUI Bubble Chart](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/bubble) offers extensive customization options for series representation, allowing developers to tailor the visual aspects of the chart to better convey data insights. One notable feature is the ability to incorporate images within the bubble segments, enhancing the chart's interactivity and visual appeal.
